and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base.

The palate feels thick and on the cusp of syrupy, with baked, creamy black-fruit flavors that bring carob, chocolate and herbs accents to a modest finish. This is ripe in feel but still smells and tastes a bit herbal.                                                                        1\n","The Acrobat bottling is one of Oregon's best sub-$20 Pinot Noirs, and a fine example of what might be called “new wave” styling. It's sleek, nervy, built on a spine of steel rather than wood. The bright berry fruit carries a pleasing hint of chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                          1\n","This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.    1\n","The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show.                                                                                                                                                                          1\n","Smooth in the mouth, this Chard starts off with citrus and dust aromas with a light edging of cake frosting. In the mouth, it's tauter and more austere than it usually is. Clean and not a vibrant wine, but that's a matter of preference. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.                                                                                                                                                           1\n","Name: description, Length: 97821, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.loc[df['description'] == 'A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base.
